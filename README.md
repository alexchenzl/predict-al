Prototype of predicting Ethereum transactions' access lists

The project idea comes from [CDAP cohort-one](https://github.com/ethereum-cdap/cohort-one/issues/26).

The current design is to use a simplified EVM to execute transaction payloads, and record the access list. 

Most of the source code is based on go-ethereum. It's still ongoing.
